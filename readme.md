A simple blog for my brother, Professor Interesting.

## business value

Professor Interesting did post-graduate work at Qingdao Ocean University and China Mainland Big School. He shares interesting stories that always end up relating to a computer science related lesson, which can be understood fully only by clicking on the embedded links (some of which are hidden) and reading until the end. Only a preselected (but expandable, by design) group of 5 wallet addresses can access the edit blog features and private read-only dashboard.

## full tech stack

Because Professor Interesting wants to encourage learning through hands-on experience, this simple site should be built in React and use 5 of the following core skills:

- [ ] style in css modules
- [ ] routing
- [ ] labeling with htmlFor
- [ ] handling event props
- [ ] creating wrapper components
- [ ] web3 wallet login giving access to read-only dashboard
- [ ] IPFS .json metadata blob for each post

## meetups

> or, how to get access to the read-only dashboard

ultimately, this blog will be limited to 10,000 collectable posts. ownership of the most posts will give access to the read-only dashboard. bidding rules are configurable by Professor Interesting when sending an http post request to the database.
